This analysis is to review PyBer ride share data.
To do this, the creation of data frames was necessary to be able to compare the fares, drivers, ride, by city type, (Urban, Suburban, Rural)

1) Fares generated in January through April are at it's lowest in January for Rural, Suburban and Urban cities.
2) In the mid to late February, fares saw a moderate spike up for Rural, Suburban, and Urban cities.
3) Urban cities see an increase in fares starting in mid January that averagely continues through April.
4) Suburban cities see an increase in fares starting in mid January with boosts in early March and late April.
5) Rural cities experienced more fare volaltiliy than Urban and Suburban with two spikes up in mid February and mid April otherwise it is almost a straight line.


Summary
----

By looking at the data it is easy to see that the highest ride activity and total fares are being generated in the urban cities. 
Urban cities generally have constant activity so they are nice and continuous revenue generators. However, their average fare per ride and per driver was lower than 
the other two cities types. This was probably due to a lot more shorter ride times.

That does not mean that Rural and Suburban cities should be forgotten about. Suburban cities has a nice steady inflow of fares generated. They did see two nice 
spikes in the middle of February and beginning of April. This increase in activity in the Suburbs could be do to the fact that the people are traveling more for 
spring and summer vacations. Rural cities can get pretty slow at times but they too saw increases in late February and early April. Rural cities have the highest 
average per ride fares and averager per driver fares.
